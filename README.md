# 🛍️ Ecomzy – Redux E-commerce App

**Ecomzy** is a beautifully designed e-commerce frontend built with **React** and **Redux Toolkit**. It fetches product data from a public API and allows users to browse, view prices, and add products to their cart. The application demonstrates state management using Redux Toolkit and offers a scalable boilerplate for beginner-to-intermediate frontend developers.

Let me know if you want to include:
- **Cart page** functionality (if implemented)
- **Responsive design optimizations**
- **Authentication placeholders**
- Or convert it into a full-stack app with backend support

Also, if you want the `screenshot.png` placeholder replaced with your actual UI screenshot (the one you uploaded), I can provide the Markdown for that too.
